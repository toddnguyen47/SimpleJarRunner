# SimpleJarRunner

Simple JAVA jar runner executable with optional icon!

# How to Use

- Move the `javajar.exe` file to the `bin` folder where you have your Java installed. For example,
  if you installed to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.8.0_201`, copy `javajar.exe`
  to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.8.0_201\bin`. Notice the **bin** at the end!
- On your `.jar` file, right click on it, click on "Open With", and find the `javajar.exe`
  file you copied into the Java folder earlier.
- You're set!
